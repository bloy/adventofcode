Consolidated repository for advent of code

I do Advent of Code as a fun mental exercise. Occasionally, I'll do old
problems in a new language or in a new way to learn a new language or learn
something about the standard library of a language I already know.

I generally do not go for code golf or leaderboard competition. Instead I
try to write some code I can understand next year and that I might be able to
use as an example in documentation somewhere.
